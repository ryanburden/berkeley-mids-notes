- Limited Resources for an Algorithm (usually there is a tradeoff)
    - Storage Space
    - Time 
- Superset: all possible subsets of your original set

- Factors influencing run time:
    - dataset size
    - processor/memory speed
    - other processes on same cpu
    - operating system
    - implementation language
