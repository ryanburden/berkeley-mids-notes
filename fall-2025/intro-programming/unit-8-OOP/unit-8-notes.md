Principles of OOP
- Encapsulation
    - classes group data and methods together
- Abstraction
    - class interface hides interior details
- Inheritance
    - classes gain behaviors of their parents
- Polymorphism
    - different classes can play the same role 

- Duck typing:Python allows operations on any object with the correct attributes

Class Inheritance
- Simulations
    - Stochastic proceess: variable changing over time
        - example: stock price over time, weather temp for each day
