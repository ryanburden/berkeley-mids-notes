Introduction

Unit 2 is about the foundations of subject rights online, with regards to experiments and modern data science and analytics. This topic was initially laid out in The Belmont Report (1979), and more recently by The Menlo Report (2012) to revisit with an emphasis on modern method and technology, especially data.

Key Words
- Informed consent
- Belmont Report
- Respect for persons
- Beneficince
- Justice
- Hawthorne Effect

Module Learning Objectives
- MLO 2.1: Evaluate the ethical risks involved in data science projects.
- MLO 2.2: Apply "respect for persons," "beneficence," and "justice" as outlined in the Belmont Report.
- MLO 2.3: Defend the applicability of the Belmont Report principles in data science.
- MLO 2.4: Discuss the role of informed consent and its impact on research.

Video Notes

One of the big ideas from Belmont and Menlo Reports is consent in research and defining informed consent.

The key is to inform the subjects enough so that they know what they are getting into, but no so much that their knowledge affects their behavior and damages the experiment- AKA Hawthorne Effect.

Case Study: Henrietta Lacks
- Her cancerous cells were collected and used for research without her consent. These cells are still alive today and have been used for thousands of studies in hundreds of domains. Patents and profits have been made surrounding her cells.
- Research and practice have and should be kept seperate, but not in this case.

The Belmont Report
- Preceeded by the Nuremberg Code which set forth ethical principals for research with human subjects in response to cruel Nazi research.
- Tuskeegee experiments 1932. Poor black men were researched for syphillis treatment. Patients were only given placebos and were denied treatments to observe full progression of the disease.
- The experiment was continued until all participants had died.
- SF Whistleblower Pete Buxton shed light on the cruel experiment, but it was continued.

- Respect for Persons
    - Informed consent, voluntariness.
- Beneficence
    - Are there benefits to the individuals whose information we are collecting?
    - Can any harms come to them? How do we minimize them.
    - We need to balance these with the research's benefits to society as a whole.
    - What could others do with this data? Think data reusing, data breaches, hacks.
    - Think like a "Black Hat security researcher"
- Justice
    - How might different demographics be affected by this research as subjects or members of society.
    - Henrietta Lacks example: Poor black family faces the consequences without seeing direct benefit.
    - About the subjects and who stands to benefit or lose from the knowledge gained from research.
    - What parts of the population contributed to this data? Who is made vulnerable? Who stand to benefit?
    - Likewise, who is underrepresented or overrepresented in the dataset?

Beyond the Belmont
- Belmont report was codified in The Common Rule in 1991, and updated in 2019.
- Informed consent is the most common issue in modern experimentaton and data collection.

The Menlo Report
- Applies original three Belmont principles to cybersecurity context and adds a 4th "respect for law and public interest"
- Explores risk of re-identification and types of sensitive data.
- How are benefits and burdens distrubted across society?
- 4th principle asks researchers to be as transparent as possible in their methods to foster trust

Consent and A/B Testing
- Does consent bias research?
- Consent fatigue: data subjects are overwhelmed by requests for consent. 
- Sampling methods can be used to alleviate over or under representation.
- A small amount of inprecision is a small price to pay to conduct ethically responsible research
- Deception isn't forbidden in research. It should only be used as a last resort tool.
- Private companies are technically allowed to follow IRB or Common Rule.

Writing Strategies
- Know your audience. Who are you writing for and what is their incentive structure? What language would resonate with them the most?
- Be ready to step away from your writing.
- Get a peer review.
- How often do we disclose the intent of our research to subjects?

Assignment 1
- Apply Belmont Principles to a contemporary use case.
- Describe how each of these principles is relevant or not
- Consider the broader limits of use case, beyond Belmont report.
