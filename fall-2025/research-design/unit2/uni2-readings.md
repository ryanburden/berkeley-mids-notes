1. Creswell & Creswell, Chapter 4: â€œWriting Strategies and Ethical Considerations.
- Start by planning the major topics that will be covered in the study proposal. Use Maxwell's (2013) list of core arguments
- Write 4 unpolished drafts instead of one polished draft. Follow a 3-step pipeline:
    - Develop an outline
    - Write draft and move around ideas
    - Edit and polish each sentence
- Use consistent terms throughout the paper. Do not use synonyms for the central phenomena.
- Be mindful of coherence. Zinsser (1983) suggested that every sentence should be a logical sequel to the one that preceded it.
- Use the active voice as much as possible.

2. The Belmont Report
- Practice vs Research
    - Practice: provide treatment, diagnosis, therapy
    - Research: test hypothesis, develop generalizable knowledge

- Respect for persons
    - Individuals should be treated as autonomous agents. Persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to protection.
    - Lack of respect for an agent is to repudiate their judgements, deny freedoms, and withold necessary information.
    - Subjects must enter experiment voluntarily and with adequate information.
- Beneficence
    - Persons are treated with ethics by respecting their decisions, protecting them from harm, and making efforts to secure their well-being.
    - "Beneficence" = acts of kindness or charity that go beyong strict obligation.
    - Do not harm. Maximize possible benefits. Minimize possible harms.
    - Learning what will benefit a person may require exposing them to risk.
- Justice
    - Who ought to receive the benefits of research and bear its burdens? Equals ought to be treated equally.
    - Are people from certain classes being selected because of their vulnerable status, and not their relevance to the study?

- Informed consent, risk/benefit assessment, selection of subjects.
    - incomplete disclosure is only appropriate when its truly necessary, there are no undisclosed risks, and there is an adequate debriefing plan.

- Comprehension
    - The manner and context in which the information is displayed is as important as the information itself.

- Voluntariness
    - coercion occurs when an overt threat of harm is presented to obtain compliance
    - undue influence occurs through an offer of excessive, unwarranted reward.

Case Study: Is your driving being secretly scored?

- You might have a driver score which is based on your driving habits. Things like slamming on brakes, speed, looking at phone, and driving late at night.

- In the past, auto insurers would ask consumers for enrollment in driving monitoring programs, but the public has been reluctant.
- Possible upsides: more fair rates, tailored to each driver. Safe driving will be promoted IF monitoring is made aware.
- Life360, MyRadar, GasBuddy have driver monitoring features that are provided by an Allstate subsidiary. Users agree to Arity privacy statement.
- Auto insurers can retrieve these driving scores instantly.
-  "we may collect third party data and reports."
