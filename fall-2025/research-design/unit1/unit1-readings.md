1. Is Data Science a science?
- Major problem: communication between data scientists and non-technical stakeholders. People use assumptions to fill in gaps of misunderstanding.
- Start every conversation with a quick education.
- Grand formula of knowledge: Life = what we think we know + Random Unknown
- Similarly, Real data = A model explaining data + random error
- Is data science a science..? Yes. It discovers previously unknown facts, it uses a systematic approach, it creates reproducible results.

2. The First Thing Great Decision Makers Do
- The key to decision making is framing the decision context before you seek data.
- Without discipline, you are susceptible to cognitive bias. Set the goalposts first, so you don't unconsciously move them later.
- Decision criteria are the best antidote to confirmation bias.
- The "Ikea Effect". People value things more when they've put time and effort into it.
- To avoid this, frame. 
    - First what is your default action, the action that you will perform in the absence of data?
    - Next, think about how you will react to the data when it arrives
    - Then, create a metric that can tell you which world is best.
    - Finally, consider what magnitude of evidence is required to stray from default and what your risk tolerance is. Then, you can finally get into the numbers.

3. How to Read a Paper
- The "Three Pass Approach"
    - Read the paper in three passes, instead of one-time beginning to end. Each pass builds upon learnings from the previous pass. The first pass gives a general idea. The second pass lets you grasp the content. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.
- The first pass
    - Quick scan to get a bird's-eye view of the paper. Read the title, abstract, and intro. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else. Read the conclusions. Glance at references.
    - You should be able to answer 5 C's
        - Category
        - Context
        - Correctness
        - Contributions
        - Clarity

- The second pass
    - Look carefully at figures, diagrams, and illustrations
    - You should be able to summarize paper to someone else

- The third pass
    - Attempt to virtually re-implement the paper.

5. How to Lie with Statistics
- Written by Darrell Huff in 1954, dives into the pitfalls and trickery of statistics. Storks deliver babies! Gave rise to statistical cynicism.
- Hill discovered correlation between smoking and lung cancer through hospital surveys and statistical analysis.
- Power of doubt: It's easier to argue against something than in favor of it.
- Darrel Huff was hired by big tobacco to spread doubt in cigarette-cancer causation claims.

6. The Golden Rule
- The greater the proficiency, the more acute the polarization. Curiosity breaks this pattern.
- Curiosity forms in the gap between what we know and what we want to know.
- The illusion of explanatory depth. When confronted with their lack of undestanding, political polarization decreased.`
