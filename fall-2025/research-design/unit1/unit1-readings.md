1. Is Data Science a science?
- Major problem: communication between data scientists and non-technical stakeholders. People use assumptions to fill in gaps of misunderstanding.
- Start every conversation with a quick education.
- Grand formula of knowledge: Life = what we think we know + Random Unknown
- Similarly, Real data = A model explaining data + random error
- Is data science a science..? Yes. It discovers previously unknown facts, it uses a systematic approach, it creates reproducible results.

2. The First Thing Great Decision Makers Do
- The key to decision making is framing the decision context before you seek data.
- Without discipline, you are susceptible to cognitive bias. Set the goalposts first, so you don't unconsciously move them later.
- Decision criteria are the best antidote to confirmation bias.
- The "Ikea Effect". People value things more when they've put time and effort into it.
- To avoid this, frame. 
    - First what is your default action, the action that you will perform in the absence of data?
    - Next, think about how you will react to the data when it arrives
    - Then, create a metric that can tell you which world is best.
    - Finally, consider what magnitude of evidence is required to stray from default and what your risk tolerance is. Then, you can finally get into the numbers.
