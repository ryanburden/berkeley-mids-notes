1. Data Detective, Rule Six: Ask Who is Missing

- Sample error
    - risk that, by chance, a randomly chosen sample of opinions does not reflect the true views of the population

- Sample bias  
    - when the sample isn't randomly chosen at all
    - Example, the 1936 presidential poll sampled people from telephone and vehicle registrations. This is wealthy subset

2. Creswell & Creswell Ch 8: Quantitative Methods

- Survey Design
    - provides a quantitative description of trends, attitudes, and opinions of a population, or tests for associations among variables of a population.
    - answers 3 types of questions: descriptive questions, relationships between variables, predictive relationships between variables over time

- Experimental Design
    - systematically manipulates one or more variables to evaluate how this manipulation affects an outcome.
    - isolates this effect by holding all other variables constant

- Sampling
    - random sample: each individual has an equal probability of being selected

- Population stratification
    - stratify so that individuals represented in the sample are reflects the true proportion in the population of individuals with certain characteristics.

- Instruments and Measures
    - Instruments: devices  for collecting measures of variables
    - Measures: some characteristic of study participants

- Data analysis:
    - Response bias: the effect of nonresponses on survey estimates
    - provide descriptive analysis for all predictor and outcome variables

- Experiment Design
    - random assignment: when individuals are randomly assigned into groups, it is called a true experiment. Designs in which a researcher has partial control over random assignment is a quasi-experiment
    - manipulation check: check to see if you successfully manipulated your independent variable
- Threats to validity
    - internal validity threat: 
    - external validity threat
