2. Kuhn
- Normal science is like solving a puzzle
- Paradigm testing occurs after persistent failure to solve a noteworthy puzzle leads to crisis.
- Testing occurs as a competition between two rival paradigms.
- Verification: select the most viable paradigm given the environment
- Popper believes in falsification. Theories should be rejected based on falsehoods. Kuhn says every theory has a degree of falsehood and that it is better to see which paradigm fits better.
- Proponents of competing paradigms practice their trades in different worlds.
- Paradigm shift happens if new option is neater, simpler.

3. The Art of Asking Smarter Questions
- 5 types of strategic questions:
    - investigative, speculative (what if), productive (now what?), interpretive (so what?), subjective (what's unsaid?)

4. 
- Qualitative
    - meaning to a social or human problem via interpretation
    - inductive reasoning
- Quantitative
    - examines the relationships among variables
    - measurements and numbered data are analyzed with stats
- Mixed Methods 
    - both qual and quant data.
- Research occurs within philosophical worldviews
    - worldview: A set of beliefs that guide action
    - four examples:
- Postpositivism
    - determinism, reductionalism, empirical observation, "scientific method"
- Constructivism
    - understanding, multiple participant meanings, social and historical construction
- Transformative
    - political, power/justice oriented, collaborative, change
- Pragmatism
    - consequences of actions, problem centerd, pluralistic, real world practice

- Quantitative Designs
    - survey research, experimental research
- Qualitative Designs
    - descriptive method, narrative research, grounded theory, case studies
- For assignment 5, make executive summary for deliverables 2 and 3
