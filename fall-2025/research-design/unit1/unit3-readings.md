1. Embracing Agile

- Most leaders don't know enough about Agile, and take actions that counter its benefits. There are 6 rules to becoming more Agile.

- 1. Learn How Agile Really Works

    - Different Varieties of Agile
        - Scrum
            - creative and adaptive teamwork to solve complex problems.
        - Lean Development
            - focuses on the continual elimination of waste.
        - Kanban
            - reducing lead times and the amount of work process
    - Work is done in groups of 3-9 cross-functional people with a business-role Product Owner.

- 2. Understand Where Agile Does and Does Not Work
    - Works best in IT or software development, where problems are complex and modular.
    - The Agile Manifesto
        - People over process and tools
        - Respond to change instead of following a plan
        - Working prototypes over excessive documentation 
        - Customer collaboration over rigid contracts

- 3. Start small and let the word spread
- 4. Allow "Master" Teams to Customize their Practices
- 5. Practice Agile at the Top
    - Useful for strategy allocation and resource development
- 6. Destroy the Barriers to Agile Behaviors
    - Get everyone on the same page. If a new mobile app is top priority for development teams, it should also be the same priority for QA teams, integration, budgeting, etc. Example: Fex/fel is critical to many high priority teams at AI Labs, yet the team resposibile for the tool does not prioritize it the same. This creates slowness, blockers, and resentment within my team.
    - Name only one boss for each decision. Think Baharak, Ananth, Ajay, PMs fighting.

2. Are You Solving the Right Problems? Wedell-Wedellsborg, T

- Biggest pitfall is overcomplicating the diagnostic process. Best diagnoses come from an alternative definition of your problem
- The Slow Elevator Problem:
    - Problem: Slow elevator. First solution: replace elevator. Reframed solution: Place mirrors near elevator.
    - Make the elevator faster vs. make the wait feel shorter
