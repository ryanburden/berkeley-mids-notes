1. Statistical Inference in 1 Sentence
- Does the evidence we collected make the null hypothesis look ridiculous?
- Step 1: What is the default action?
- Step 2: What is the alternative action?
- Step 3: What is the numm hypothesis?
- Step 4: What is the alternative hypothesis?

- You should get into the habit of learning nothing more often, because if you insist on learning something beyond the data everytime you test hypotheses, you will learn something stupid.

- Analytics cares about what's here. while statistics cares more about what isn't
- Stats is the science of changing your mind under uncertainty

2. cresswell and cresswell ch 3

- Theory can be a prediction of what the researcher expects to find or an inductive or deductive framework for a study

-  theory in quantitative research is “a set of interrelated constructs (variables), definitions, and propositions that presents a systematic view of phenomena by specifying relations among variables, with the purpose of explaining natural phenomena” (p. 64).

- Variables
- independent variable: influece outcome of study
- dependent variable: depends on the independent variable
- predictor variable: predict an outcome of interest in a study, and cannot be systematically manipulated
- outcome variable: outcome of predictor var
- intervening/mediating var: transmit the effect of an ind var to a dep var.
- moderating variable: a predictor variable that affect the direction/strength of relationship between ind and dep / predictor and outcome
- confounding var: 3rd var that is related to the ind and the dep

- hypothesis: prediction about an event or relationship between variables

3. cresswell and creswell ch 6 purpose statement
- purpose statement: establishes the intent or objective of the research study
- it is not the problem, issue, or research questions
- purpose builds on a problem and is refined into specific questions
- qualitative purpose statement, a researcher needs to identify a single central phenomenon and to pose a tentative definition for it. strong action words: discover, develop, understand
- quantitative - theory, variables relationships, comparisons and uses words like relationship, correlation, and description

4. creswell and creswell ch 7 research questions and hypotheses
- narrow the purpose statement
- quantitative - relationships among variables and uses statistical procedures. compare/relate/describe
    - state variables
    - include a theory
    - create a directional alternative hypothesis, affect, influence, predict, impact, cause, determine

- qualitative
    -   inquirers state research questions, not hypothesis
    - central question + subquestions
    - use exploratory verbs that convey the language of emerging design

5. the data detective, rule 3: avoid premature enumeration
- looking for an explanation  means looking for someone to blame. maybe no one is to blame (data collection, different practices)
- when understanding any statistical claim, we need to ask what the claim actually means
- dont dive into the mathematics of a claim before undersatnding what is being measured, counted, and what definitions are being used. = "premature enumeration"
