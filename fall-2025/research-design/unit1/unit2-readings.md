Introduction

Unit 2 is about the foundations of subject rights online, with regards to experiments and modern data science and analytics. This topic was initially laid out in The Belmont Report (1979), and more recently by The Menlo Report (2012) to revisit with an emphasis on modern method and technology, especially data.

Video Notes

One of the big ideas from Belmont and Menlo Reports is consent in research and defining informed consent.

The key is to inform the subjects enough so that they know what they are getting into, but no so much that their knowledge affects their behavior and damages the experiment- AKA Hawthorne Effect.

Case Study: Henrietta Lacks
- Her cancerous cells were collected and used for research without her consent. These cells are still alive today and have been used for thousands of studies in hundreds of domains. Patents and profits have been made surrounding her cells.
- Research and practice have and should be kept seperate, but not in this case.

The Belmont Report
- Preceeded by the Nuremberg Code which set forth ethical principals for research with human subjects in response to cruel Nazi research.
- Tuskeegee experiments 1932. Poor black men were researched for syphillis treatment. Patients were only given placebos and were denied treatments to observe full progression of the disease.
- The experiment was continued until all participants had died.
- SF Whistleblower Pete Buxton shed light on the cruel experiment, but it was continued.

- Respect for Persons
    - Informed consent, voluntariness.
