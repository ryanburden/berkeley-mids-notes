1.1 Intro

This unit is about linear functions. We will start by defining a function.\

1.2 What is a function?\

Def. A function f is a rule that assigns to each input x in its domain an output f(x) in its codomain\

Terms:\
    - Domain = Set of all inputs\
    - Codomain = Superset of all outputs\
    - Range = Set of all outputs\

Notation:\
$f:R^n -> R^m$ means..\
$R^n$ = Domain of f\
$R^m$ Codomain of f

Note: the codomain is the set of all possible output values, while the range is the subset of the codomain that contains only the actual output values produced by the function for a given domain

Formal definition: A function is a triple <f, D, C> where D is the domain, C is to codomain, and f is a subset of D cross C satisfying the function property

Representing Functions:\
formulas\
$f(x) = x^2$\
$y = x^2$\
$x -> x^2$\
$x^2$\
$(.)^2$\
^2

sets\
${(x,y): y = x^2}$
