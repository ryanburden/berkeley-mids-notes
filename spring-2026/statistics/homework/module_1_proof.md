(a) That the number is possible; but, importantly, 
(b) That no greater number is possible.

P(A) = 0.5
P(B) = 0.75




In the case that P(A ∪ B) is the entire sample space, ie: P(A ∪ B) = 1:

P(A ∪ B) = P(A)+P(B)−P(A ∩ B)
1 = 0.5 + 0.75 - P(A ∩ B)
1 = 1.25 - P(A ∩ B)
P(A ∩ B) = 0.25

In the case that P(A ∪ B) is the minimum possible size, meaning that events A and B completely overlap, 
ie: P(A ∪ B) = 0.75:

P(A ∪ B) = P(A)+P(B)−P(A ∩ B)
0.75 = 1.25 - P(A ∩ B)
P(A ∩ B) = 0.5
