(a) That the number is possible; but, importantly, 
(b) That no greater number is possible.

P(A) = 0.5
P(B) = 0.75



MAXIMUM

The maximum possible value of P(A ∩ B) is 0.5
According to the definition of an intersection, the intersection of events A and B is a subset of event A:
A ∩ B ⊆ A
Using the Basic Property of Probability Monotonicity:
P(A∩B) <= P(A)
Substituting P(A) = 0.5
P(A∩B) <= 0.5
If Event A is a subset of B, A ⊆ B
The intersection of events A and B is simply A, A∩B = A
Therefore,
P(A∩B)=P(A)=0.5
Showing that the maximum value of 0.5 is possible

Addition Rule of Probability: P(A ∪ B) = P(A)+P(B)−P(A ∩ B)
0.75 = 1.25 - P(A ∩ B)
P(A ∩ B) = 0.5





In the case that P(A ∪ B) is the entire sample space, ie: P(A ∪ B) = 1:

P(A ∪ B) = P(A)+P(B) − P(A ∩ B)
1 = 0.5 + 0.75 - P(A ∩ B)
1 = 1.25 - P(A ∩ B)
P(A ∩ B) = 0.25

In the case that P(A ∪ B) is the minimum possible size, meaning that events A and B completely overlap, 
ie: P(A ∪ B) = 0.75:

Addition Rule of Probability: P(A ∪ B) = P(A)+P(B)−P(A ∩ B)
0.75 = 1.25 - P(A ∩ B)
P(A ∩ B) = 0.5

It is not possible for P(A ∩ B) to be greater than 0.5. An example is shown below:

P(A ∪ B) = P(A)+P(B)−P(A ∩ B)
P(A ∪ B)  = 0.5 + 0.75 - 0.51
P(A ∪ B)  = 0.74 

The Addition Rule of probability states that this would require the intersection of events A and B to have a probability greater than the probability of event A, which is not possible, according to The Law of Total Probability.
