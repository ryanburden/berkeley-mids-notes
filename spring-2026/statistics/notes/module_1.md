#### Properties of Unions:

- Symmetry: A U B = B U A
- Association: (A U B) U C = A U (B U C)
- A U A = A
- A U 0 = A

###### Set Intersection:
Two Sets are disjoint if their intersection is empty

#### Properties of Intersections
- Symmetry : $A\cap B$ = $B\cap A$
- Association: $(A\cap B)\cap C$ = $A\cap (B\cap C)$
- $A\cap A = A$
- $A\cap \empty = \empty$
- Both union and intersections can be distributed
- Set difference of A and B is A\B
- Set difference can be distributed

#### Set Complement
- $\Omega$ ALL objects of interest
- Complement $A^C$ = $\Omega$ \ $A$

###### Properties
- $A^C\cup A = \Omega$
- $A$ \ $B$ = $A \cap B^C$
